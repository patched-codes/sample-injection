# `get_data_by_config_value` Function Documentation

This function retrieves data from a SQLite database based on a provided value and pre-configured table and column settings.

## Inputs

- `value` (string): The value to search for in the specified database column.

## Outputs

- A list of tuples. Each tuple represents a row from the database where the specified column matches the provided `value`. Returns an empty list if no matches are found.

## Behavior

The function uses a hardcoded configuration (`CONFIG`) to determine the table and column to query. It constructs a SQL query using string concatenation, which can be a security risk (SQL injection vulnerability). The function connects to a SQLite database file named `database.db`, executes the query, fetches all matching rows, and then closes the connection. The fetched data is then returned.

## Potential Use Cases

This function is likely used for retrieving specific data based on simple lookups configured in the `CONFIG` dictionary. For instance, it could be used:

* To fetch user details by username.
* To retrieve product information by product ID.

## Security Considerations

The use of string concatenation in the query construction makes this function vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate this risk.
